# Contract-Advisor-RAG
Towards Building A High-Precision Legal Expert LLM APP
# Business objective  

Lizzy AI is an early-stage Israeli startup, developing the next-generation contract AI (see short video). We leverage Hybrid LLM technology (edge, private cloud and LLM services), to build the first, fully autonomous, artificial contract lawyer. The first step in our journey is a powerful contract assistant, with the ultimate goal of developing a fully autonomous contract bot, capable of drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts, independently, end-to-end, without human assistance. 

Our task is as follows:  build, evaluate and improve a RAG system for Contract Q&A (chatting with a contract and asking questions about the contract).
